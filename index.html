  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
     <U><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong></u>, commonly known as the Web, is an information syst
     em where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resour
     ce Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked
     by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of
     the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be ac
     cessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are pub
     lished by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is
     not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by
     over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.
     English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He w
     rote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Swit
     zerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to other research inst
     itutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August
      1991. The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993â€“4, when websites for gen
      eral use started to become available.[5] The World Wide Web has been centr
      al to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool bill
      ions of people use to interact on the Internet.[6][7][8][9][10]
      Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hyper
      text documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[11] Special
      HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to
      navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contai
      n references to images, video, audio, and software components which are ei
      ther displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render
      pages or streams of multimedia content. Multiple web resources with a comm
      on theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. Websites are
      stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that
       responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on
       a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a publisher, or int
       eractively from user-generated content. Websites are provided for a myria
       d of informative, entertainment, commercial, and governmental reasons.
