    <strong><u>JavaScript</strong></u> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming
    language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.<br>[10] JavaScript is hi
    gh-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.<br> It has dynamic typ
    ing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the Wo
    rld Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behav
    ior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browse
    rs have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's devi
    ce. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, function
    al, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interf
    aces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
    structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
