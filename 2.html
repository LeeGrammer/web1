  <p>
    <u><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></u> is a style sheet language used for<br><u>describing
    the presentation of a document</u> written in a markup <br>language such as HTML.
    <p>
      [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology<br> of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML an
    d JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      [2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
    <br>content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
    [3] This separation can improve
    content accessibility, provide more<br> flexibility and control in the specifica
    tion of presentation characteristics,<br> enable multiple web pages to share for
    matting by specifying the <br>relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
    complexity and <br>repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the
    .css file<br> to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages<br> that
    share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present<br> the s
    ame markup page in different styles for different rendering<br> methods, such as
    on-screen, in print, by voice <u>(via speech-based browser<br> or screen reader)</u>,
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate forma
    tting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
